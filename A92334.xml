         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu had in my laſt the Copy of the Articles of the ſurrender of <hi>Newarke;</hi> ſince which, I give you this further accompt of the performing what was there agreed to, it being ours one day ſooner then wee expected from them. For, whereas the agreement was by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on both ſides, that <hi>Newarke</hi> ſhould be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred this day to the Commiſſioners of both Kingdomes, for the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> The Governour hath bin ſo ready to haſten it, that yeſterday, being Fryday, the 8 of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> ſent to Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Poyntz</hi> to have it then ſurrendred; which, by reaſon of the ſickneſſe, being ſo hot in <hi>Newarke,</hi> he deſired to haſten; as alſo, the other Lords and Gentlemen, with the Ladies and Gentlewomen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did much deſire to be ſpeeded, as much as could be, longing for their Inlargement, which occaſioned the ſurrender a day ſooner then by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was agreed; and truely, it is become a miſerable ſtinking infected Towne, I pray God they doe not infect the Countries and Townes adjacent, which is the care of the Commiſſioners, that way be taken to prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:159688:3"/>
Yeſterday the Commiſſioners came up to ſee them march out of <hi>Newarke;</hi> they carryed not much out of the Towne, for they had but very few Carriages: we have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together 4000 Armes alreadie, and there are more; which, by reaſon of the ſickneſſe in divers places, the Officers dare not yet venture to fetch out, nor make that diligent ſearch, which will afterwards be made, ſo ſoone as with ſafetie we may.</p>
            <p>We have taken <hi>Sweet-lips</hi> (the great Gunne) which they ſo much eſteem'd of, and 11 more great pieces, two Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pieces, and divers Drakes, and other ſmall pieces, and 40 Gunpowder, with great ſtore Match, Bullets, and all ſorts of Ammunition.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Newarke</hi> Garriſon, from the greateſt to the leaſt, doe all of them generally ſeeme to be much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at their hearing, that the King hath delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe up to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and are very much troubled at the hearing thereof, which makes many of them to repent, that ever they were engaged in the ſervice, being like men in amaze at the hearing of it; And when 800 of them had marched out with the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> the Governour, and it was expected that they ſhould name to what Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould march, they would not nominate any Garriſon to march to, for the further ſervice of the King in the deſigne againſt the Parliament<hi>:</hi> But (as all the reſt that came out of <hi>Newarke,</hi> who were above 1000 more, ſo they went every one to their owne homes: So that, as I confeſſe, I know not where they could have eaſily found out any Garriſon unbeſieged to march to, according to the Articles, ſo they did not take care to put themſelves into any other priſon in that ſervice, in which they have received ſo little ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Governour (to give him his due) hath beene very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159688:3"/>
punctuall, and the conditions very exactly obſerved, and performed ſo fully, as I beleeve, ever any were, and all of them are very diligent to procure a good repute of the Parliament; the Commiſſioners and the Courtry, for which they labour much, and thereby make way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with the Parliament for their delinquency: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that all thoſe of qualitie (of whom there are many) will continue labouring to compound for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
            <p>The Countrie thereabouts are all ſummoned to come in with Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on Monday next, to aſſiſt in the demoliſhing of the Workes of <hi>Newarke,</hi> which are very many, ſtrong, and formidable, I beleeve they will come in very joyfully to that worke, which tends to ſo great an eaſe to all thoſe parts, as they have found by wofull experience, ſince they felt the oppreſſion of that Garriſon, and others, of all which they are now cleare, and all will be buried in the ruines of this, which they are forthwith to levell. Doctor <hi>Deane,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hurſt,</hi> Doctor <hi>March,</hi> and divers other malignant Clergy-men were in <hi>Newarke,</hi> who with the Gentrie, as Aldermen <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> and the reſt of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Towneſ-men, and others, are very ſad in the Towne, ſo as they walke away in a mournfull poſture; the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of thoſe parts, being now moſt troubled in their own thoughts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are marched Northward withall their whole body of Horſe and foot; the Horſe march before with the King, and with them Lieutenant Generall <hi>David Leſley;</hi> they march along with great rejoycing that they have the King with them. But the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> men, ſo ſoon as they heard that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army were to march Northward, they preſently (moſt of them) gathered their Horſes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159688:4"/>
and forthwith ſent them over Trent into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> for feare that ſome unruly Souldiers, in the Scots Army, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their march northward (coming through their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) ſhould plunder them, by which meanes there were very many horſes ſent into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and ſo the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey had not many horſes left in their grounds to looſe. The Scots Forces are marched towards <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> but I beleeve that a party of Horſe will goe before with the K<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng towards <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay that they have dealt very plainly with the King ſince he came into their Army.</p>
            <p>Wee have taken great care to prevent the Souldiers from plundering, though ſome of them did very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they were ſtript at <hi>Spittle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Governour hath had very great care of all things in <hi>Newarke,</hi> to ſee that nothing ſhould be imbezeled, and hath ſhewed himſelfe very noble; there is a great change, by which God hath given us experience of his great power, in bringing downe the hearts of the proud and h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
